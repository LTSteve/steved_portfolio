Mostly built in late 2020 and early 2021, I wanted something at once more aggressive and more focused on palatability than my previous albums. I couldn't avoid some experiments, of course, as you'll see. I think my mastering and production overall improved quite a bit on this album, although I think it may be slightly lacking in terms of variety.

## Track Thoughts

Here I'll do my very best to recover some memories of what it was like to work on these tracks and what my intentions were for them.

### Traintrack

One of the more relaxed tracks on the album. I think I got a little sick of putting ambient tracks on my albums, so I ended up limiting the lower energy limit of the album to more midtempo tracks with the occasional Vaporwave-ish track coming back as well. Plenty of cool sounds on this track though.

### Meatbags

Yes, that's a *KOTOR* sample. The driving kick and bassline worked pretty well to keep this track rolling, and the samples lend identity.  

### WhatRU

This track is a bit of a tug of war between more aggressive elements (such as the kick) and more fantastical elements (like the fluttering synth that pokes up every once in a while). The contrast helps the track feel complete.

### Vanishing Land

A Vaporwave/Trip Hop track built on a fairly short sample from an AI generated track as part of the "AI generates genres that don't exist". I've forgotten what exactly the input was for this one, but as you may expect most of the track was ambient swooshing. I believed I sampled some of the swooshing for ambience as well.

### Drum Trippin

This one is 100% an experiment. The idea was to automate a drum loop and use it in more of the role that synths play in a typical track. I then used a few automated droning synths to fill in the role percussion usually plays. The result in this case is quite dark and intense actually. It occasionally gives me a bit of a pit in my stomach, similar to the first time I heard Metal. Whether that's good or bad is up to you I suppose.

### Greentown

From one of the darkest tracks to one of the brightest. I pulled a bit from house on this track and was focused simply on creating something enjoyable and (relative to my normal) positive. I really like how the chords turned out, they're crunchy and dated in a good way.

### Vast Distance

This track makes me think of an alien landscape at night. Things you don't quite understand are filling the world around you with some sort of life you still haven't gotten a good look at. Somehow the lead synth reminds me a bit of *Metroid Prime*.

### Deep Signal

The closest thing to an Ambient track on this album. A derelict space ship drifts alone in a sea of stars. Small parts of unknown purpose still function. Somehow, this track feels that way.

### Eye Clone

Here I fall back a bit on my standard style. The lead synth does a good job of conveying an intensity throughout the track. I'd say this track may have some stylistic origins in the original Doom sound track, but it's hard to say.

### Not Even Anything

The odd contrast between the vocal-ish sounding crunchy pad and the lead synth built out of an actual vocal sample is the heart of what makes this track work. It's really a minimal track, with only 5 lanes (including one devoted to the kick rumble).

### Goin For A Walk

I love the sound of a lightly distorted 808 bend. This track was mainly an excuse to use one. The ambience in this track is derived from the sampled, morphed, and reverbed piano. The samples (ambient footsteps and the vocal sample) are from an early *Animal Crossing* trailer I believe.

### Chain

The vocal sample plays a weird role in this track. It's both something to set the ambience and something that fights against and contrasts the instrumentation. It gives a lot of tension that isn't ever fully broken as the vocal sample ends up 'winning out' in the end.

### Industrial Crystal Production

This track has a great EBM-ish groove and a unique lead synth. I believe the plan was to have a vocal lead in this track (perhaps instead of the lead) but I couldn't overcome my nerves at the time and decided to just wrap it up.

### Hollow Refuge

The final Vaporwave influenced Ambient-ish track on the album. The lead sounds kind of empty on this one leading to the name of the track. I probably should have have turned it down about 5 dB. Near the end of the track the piano shifts into a major key for a few bars, but the lead doesn't follow.

### Evolve

The kick and snare groove are less Techno here and more Dance. The resonant baseline gives a dark, but less intense feeling to this track. The focus is mainly based around the lead melody though.
