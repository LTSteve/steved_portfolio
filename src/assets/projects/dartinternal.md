# Dart Container Internal Tools

After my time working with the Web Communications team on Dart's public facing website I transitioned to working on the Web Development team's projects. This meant many new tools to learn, and several projects to understand. You can see the list of languages, frameworks, and tools this team used. Most of these were new to me at the time.

## Tooling

Server: **ASP .Net**
Templating: **Razor**
Front End Framework: [**Durandal**](https://github.com/BlueSpire/Durandal), [**SAP UI5**](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com)
Front End Languages: **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**
Back End Languages: **C#**
Server: [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com)
Agile Project Management: **TFS** (now known as **Azure DevOps Server**)

## Devlog

The functionality of the internal projects I worked on at Dart Container included:
- Quoting prices to potential clients
- Managing distribution contracts
- Pulling and displaying up-to-date product pricing
- Managing salesperson workflow

Although I started out pretty green in terms of full stack Web Development, I picked up what I needed to know of our process fairly quickly.  Beyond learning the technology stack, I also gained valuable insight into working with product owners on an Agile team, and working with a UX design team.
