## Devlog

The functionality of the internal projects I worked on at Dart Container included:
- Quoting prices to potential clients
- Managing distribution contracts
- Pulling and displaying up-to-date product pricing
- Managing salesperson workflow

Although I started out pretty green in terms of full stack Web Development, I picked up what I needed to know of our process fairly quickly.  Beyond learning the technology stack, I also gained valuable insight into working with product owners on an Agile team, and working with a UX design team. Unfortunately there isn't anything I can actually show of this work as the specifics are fairly well protected.
