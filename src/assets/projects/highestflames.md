This album is a collection of Techno and Ambient tracks from a project I worked on in late August / early September of 2020 called **|]um¶sterƒiræday** (Dumpster-fire a day). I spent this time producing one track a day, to the best of my ability. Many of these tracks took less than two hours to create, though some took most of a day.

## Track Thoughts

Here I'll do my very best to recover some memories of what it was like to work on these tracks and what my intentions were for them.

### Void Egg

The use of vocal samples as instruments in this track really gives it an organic feel. Arpeggios with their bite removed by a low pass filter and played with lots of reverb are one of my favorite elements in music production.

### Darklight City

The techno kick was subdued a bit in this track to make room for a more cinematic Synthwave-ish feel.

### Sky Skimmer

The grove given by the kick alone was enough for me to build a track around. I couldn't resist adding a bit of a melodic element, however. I think the composition here really tells a story, understanding the order of bits a track as a bit like the progression of a story was a real game changer for me.

### Match Head

My attempt at a high energy track. To me, it feels like nervous energy and tension.

### Tren

One of the Ambient track on the album. The concept behind this track was the feeling of hearing a train in the distance outside your window as you're just falling asleep.

### Static Rave

I was attempting a more traditional Techno format here. I think the build up worked quite well, it's still probably more melodic than it needs to be.

### Fireplace

I bunched a few Ambient tracks together here to act as a bit of a midpoint for the album. This track is pretty minimal, it uses an ambient fireplace recording and a piano sample to evoke a burning record player.

### Sapient Thing From Another World

One of my favorite Ambient tracks I've ever made. The odd rhythms and slowly shifting sounds really serves an alien experience. Conceptually I suppose it's about an alien abduction, but really I was just having fun with weird sounds and choices.

### Dread

This track, along with several other Techno tracks on this album, was constructed in a way where all the elements were active at any given time and I would interact with the track with several automation lanes instead of traditional composition techniques. Really I just wanted a modular synth system and this was the closest I could get with the tools I had.

### Dumpster Ghost

One of the odder tracks to have made it on this album. Looking back it's possible to put many of these tracks on a spectrum between "Doing the most obvious thing each time" and "Doing the opposite of what my gut tells me". I think this track lands pretty far on the later side. It's about a ghost haunting a dumpster, I don't know what you want.

### Painted Creature

One of the earliest tracks I made in the **|]um¶sterƒiræday** experiment. I ended up leaning on some of my old sounds here, but I think in the context of the album it works.

### Overexposed

A track with lots of very bright sounds. I kept it fairly minimal to really soak in the burnt-out crunchy feeling.

### Scanning

This is a generative patch with very little manual intervention. I believe I merely adjusted some chance and intensity knobs over time and did some mastering at the end, otherwise all of the work was designing the generative systems and the sounds. It's an ok time to zone out to.

### Sunshape

An understated track. I wanted to build up the melodic element as much as everything else. I think it makes for a nice payoff in the back quarter.

### Probably Zombies

A good example of using a Techno-like kick rumble for purposes outside of danceability I think. I thought it was fitting to end this album on a bit of an odd synthesis of the Techno elements and Ambient elements I had been experimenting with throughout.
