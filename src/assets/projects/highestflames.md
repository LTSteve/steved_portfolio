A smaller album, this was my final project using [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm) as my DAW. Or at least I think it was, I've since lost the project files for this album, but I have all of them for *Dark Bidding Machine*.

The focus of this album was to integrate more atmosphere and setting into my style. I think it feels somewhat more professional than my previous works. As an album however it skews a bit experimental.

## Track Thoughts

Here I'll do my very best to recover some memories of what it was like to work on these tracks and what my intentions were for them.  This is going to be a little difficult as I seem to have misplaced the project files!

### Twilight

Kind of a mission statement for the type of atmosphere I was aiming for on this album. The generative-sounding patch that's featured throughout the track may have been done in Bitwig, but I can't find this track anywhere in my Bitwig saves. I think I remember playing with the demo version of Bitwig around the time I was making this song. I may have exported a simple generative patch and pulled it in to Reaper to build a track around. I'm sure that violates the demo TOS, but I did end up buying Bitwig eventually.

Anyway, the sweeping automations on the atmospheric effects were something I fell out of the habit of when working on later music. Bespoke automation is something I had to do in Reaper to add some motion to my tracks which is a task I tend to use Bitwig automation for now. I think it actually adds a lot and should come back.

### With The Dark

I remember theming this track around a simple story of a car driving through a haunted forest. I built out two groups to automate, the car itself (the traditional electronic music portion of the song) and the more ambient haunted forest. The forest would morph and change to inform the drama of the track. The car group I would pan left and right, and adjust volume/reverb to give it a sense of motion through a scene. I really like the final effect.

### All Messed Up

Night of the Living Dead is one of my favorite horror movies and I've used samples from it several time in the past. This, I believe, is the most recent time I've done so and will probably be the last.

Vocal samples are a fascinating thing in music. I tend to use them as a contextualizing force, something that my otherwise instrumental tracks lack. These samples can really give a track an identity, but they can also be used as a bit of a crutch (one which I end up using for the rest of the album).

### To Another Dimension

This track revolves around the idea of a pattern that breaks one eight note early. A simple concept, but a large part of the track consists of experimenting with a few ways of using that lurching feeling.

The spacy atmosphere of this track felt appropriate as it was a more experimental track. You could say it kind of sticks out on the album, I prefer to see it as adding some contrast to the more gloomy atmosphere of the rest of the tracks.

Also that sample is from Garth Marenghi's Darkplace.

### Midnight

For this track I wanted something a bit unsettling so I built it around a custom scale (I believe a minor with a lowered 5th and a lowered 7th. For instance A - B - C - D - Eb - F - Gb). It sounds remarkably musical considering how wacky that tuning is.

Something I haven't mentioned yet is the use of a free VST made by iZotope called [Vinyl](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/vinyl.html) on this album. This track uses it the most and you can really hear the delicious pitch warping that happens on the lead synth. I think I would go on to somewhat overuse this plugin in later albums, and arguably I do here too.

Also, the sample is the Spooky Space Kook from Scooby Doo.
