This was my first album using [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com) as my DAW. I had a blast building out ambient and drone tracks with the grid tool (maybe too much so). In retrospect I think the album would be better without them. I'm still proud of what I accomplished with some of the generative stuff. This was also my first album art to use AI generated art as it's base (thanks [Artbreeder](https://www.artbreeder.com/beta/image/2013bcacf6ddb0b2e87c)).

The main intention behind this album was to try and merge EBM, Witch House, and various other genre influences into a somewhat cohesive sound. There are a lot of genre experiments here. And yes, the album title was influenced by *What We Do In The Shadows*.

## Track Thoughts

Here I'll do my very best to recover some memories of what it was like to work on these tracks and what my intentions were for them.

### Dark Biddings

This track was always intended as the album intro. I decided to introduce the spoopy themes and a focus on dramatic structure. Also included is another sample from when an AI generated song went off the rails, it is clearly heavily processed in this track, but it didn't sound much better before I messed with it.

### DNE

This track was built largely with samples from an AI generated version of Frank Sinatra. I think if AI generated music gets just a little bit better, it would be fun to make an entire vaporwave or triphop album like this.

### Zapped

One of my earliest experiments with making an actual techno song.  I used a generative patch for the main voice here and cut it up into parts to use in a more structured track. I think the technique worked out quite well and I should probably do it in the future. Honestly, some lyrics could have given this track so much more identity.

### Surreal Stegosaurus

I was experimenting with heavily distorted 808-kick-type sounds and ended up sounding kind of prehistoric in a weird way. I think the chords at the beginning do a lot to set the scene.

### SyntheticForest

With this I tried to emulate a sort of dramatic field recording. All the sounds on this track were created synthetically and performed using generative methods. This was a wonderful exercise for my audio production chops, maybe if it was a minute or two long instead of almost 7 it would play better on the album.

### As I Seem To Be

Originally a dream I had. I couldn't remember the lyrics but I reproduced the melody. I'm sure its actually just something my subconscious half-remembered from a movie or something.

### Spoop Zone

I was trying to lean into as many spoopy tropes as I could manage here. EBM/Darkwave influences for sure. Somewhere I heard someone say that scary music in film is often low and high pitches with a bit of a lack in the midrange.

### Without Us

One of many attempted marriages between EBM and Witch House. This track leans more into the EBM side. The audio engineering could have spent more time in the oven for this one.

### Blue Lady

Darkwave influenced and intentionally minimalist. This one relies on the heavy reverb to provide atmosphere rather than background elements.

### Devil Frien

In a traditional electronic music move, I used several automation lanes to manage the tension and release in this track instead of traditional song structure. This was likely the start of my "dumpsterfireaday" adventure (more on that in [Highest Flames September](/article;articleName=highestflames))

### Kicked Out

Inspired by old school EBM, with Witch House screeches. This was maybe my most successful fusion of the two on this album, although it could have done with some more ambience to truly sell the witch-y-ness.

### Different Streets

This track is focused primarily on the grove. The two basslines (the more quiet of which is actually a distorted 808) play well with each other.

### Dark Machine

The only track on the album with a primarily Industrial influence. This one is particularly underproduced with four instrument lanes, which pretty well explains why some chords that sound like they came from one of my early albums. The kick and bass work though, the delay on the kick especially adds a lot of atmosphere to such an otherwise minimal track.
