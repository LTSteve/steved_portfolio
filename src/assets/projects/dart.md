# DartContainer&#46;com Rebrand

As my first project at Dart Container I worked on a rebrand of their public website. I continued coming back and developing features throughout my time at Dart from 2014 to 2016.

The site is still up [here](https://dartcontainer.com), but has been constantly developed since I worked on it.

## Tooling

CMS: [**Umbraco**](https://umbraco.com)
Server: **ASP .Net** (Although most of that is handled by Umbraco)
Templating: **Razor**
Front End Features: **Javascript**, **jQuery**, **HTML**, **CSS**
Agile Project Management: **TFS** (now known as **Azure DevOps Server**)

## Devlog

I came to the company in 2014 and was hired in on the Web Development team. At the time, the team was mainly focused on building internal tools for Dart salespeople.

As this was my first job out of college and I still had a lot to learn about web development I was first assigned to assist the Web Communications team on a rebrand of the company's front facing website. The Dart public site site hadn't been updated since around 2005 and as you can see below the site was usable, but understandably dated.

After some initial research on Umbraco (this was my first time using a CMS at all let alone developing for one) I set about prototyping. I put together a simple demo of the most recent mock-up for the new design. This helped me practice the basics and to get a feel for what the process of feedback and iteration would be like. After a short feedback and iteration process I was ready to truly start on the project. With the help of some senior devs who were more experienced with Agile the Web Communications team and I built out a backlog on TFS.

## What Went Well

- The site rebrand, though not a full victory, was successful and is still being iterated on to this day
- Knowledge share between the Web Communications and Web Development teams strengthened both teams
- I gained lots of experience, both technical and interpersonal

## What Didn't Go Well

- The cultures of the Web Communications and Web Development teams were very different and clashed frequently
